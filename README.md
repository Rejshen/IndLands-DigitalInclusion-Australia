#  IndLands – Digital Information System for Rural & Indigenous Farming Communities  
**Queensland University of Technology (QUT) | Group 22 – IAB204: Business Analysis Project**  
*Developed under Queensland Government Case Brief – AUD 20M Project Budget*

---

##  Project Overview

**IndLands** is a proposed **mobile and web-based information system** designed to empower **rural and Indigenous farming communities** in Australia.  
The system bridges the **digital divide** by providing real-time access to **market data**, **weather forecasts**, and **farming best practices**, while preserving Indigenous ecological knowledge and promoting digital inclusion.

Developed through structured business analysis and feasibility evaluation, IndLands demonstrates a full end-to-end **system development lifecycle** (SDLC) approach from research to solution design.

##  Role: *Business / Systems Analyst*

**Key Responsibilities & Achievements**
- Conducted **problem definition, stakeholder analysis, and requirements elicitation** using structured frameworks (PESTLE, SWOT, Fishbone, Gap Analysis).  
- Designed and proposed the **IndLands information system**, integrating **data visualization**, **SMS notification**, and **cloud-based data storage** features.  
- Led **requirements documentation**, including:
  - 18 detailed **user stories** with acceptance criteria  
  - 8 **use case descriptions and diagrams**  
  - **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)** and **test cases**
- Performed **technical, operational, and financial feasibility analysis** (NPV, IRR, ROI).  
- Applied **MoSCoW and Weighted Criteria** for requirement prioritization.  
- Drafted a **Transition & Change Management Plan** focusing on cultural sensitivity and user adoption.  
- Collaborated with team members across documentation, feasibility, and UX/UI mockups using agile-inspired sprints.
